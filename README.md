##What it does
Perform bulk actions easily by getting multiple search results on a single page in django admin
Ever wanted to perform a bulk action on users from multiple search queries in Django admin, but found it too tedious a job?
You could now get the results from multiple search queries collated on the same page and perform bulk action on all of them at once.

## How to use
Just click on the extension button on any Django search page and submit a comma separated list of the search queries to get all the search results. The extension should work on any Django list page with a search option.
